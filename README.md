# ML-Assignment-2

This assessment aims to help gain hands-on experience by developing and applying appropriate machine learning models and assess the correct application of the respective machine learning technique and the interpretation of the results obtained. All implementations have been done from scratch to emphasize on the implementation and clarity of the concepts applied from these models:

  1. Decision tree model with entropy implementation
  2. Adaboost
  3. Multiclass SVM
